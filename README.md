# Dancer2::Plugin::Github::Webhook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sonntagd/Dancer2-Plugin-Github-Webhook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sonntagd/Dancer2-Plugin-Github-Webhook)


## DESCRIPTION

This plugin can be used to verify if routes that are used as Github webhook payload URL use the correct secret.

## SYNOPSIS

Set the secret in your app configuration if you want it global:

```yaml
plugins:
  Github::Webhook:
    secret: '|8MVY)<[2Zh@!f39=<NSoCB02Btb#LTQ6Ty0dlA*4s'
```

Define that a route has to be correctly signed:

```perl
get '/githubinfo' => require_github_webhook_secret => sub {
    do_something_with_correctly_signed_payload();
};
```

Define that a route has to be correctly signed with a specific secret.

```perl
get '/otherwebhook' => require_github_webhook_secret 'KUksrZyREtM32mIPoxcV7Cqx' => sub {
    do_something_with_correctly_signed_payload();
};
```

```perl
get '/otherwebhook' => require_github_webhook_secret config->{githubwebhooks}->{otherwebhook} => sub {
    do_something_with_correctly_signed_payload();
};
```

## CONTROLLING ACCESS TO ROUTES

### require_github_webhook_secret [ $secret ]

```perl
    post '/delete-item/:id' => require_right delete_item => sub {
        ...
    };
```

Only executes the route's sub if the payload is correctly signed. If no secret is given, we use the one 
you configured in your config file (see above). If you need different secrets within your app, you can 
provide it here or use on from the configuration file via `config->{anyconfigentry}`.
