=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Plugin::Github::Webhook - Check Github Webhook secret

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin can be used to verify if routes that are used as Github webhook payload URL 
use the correct secret.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Set the secret in your app configuration if you want it global:

  plugins:
    Github::Webhook:
      secret: '|8MVY)<[2Zh@!f39=<NSoCB02Btb#LTQ6Ty0dlA*4s'

Define that a route has to be correctly signed:

    post '/githubinfo' => require_github_webhook_secret sub { do_something_with_correctly_signed_payload(); };

Define that a route has to be correctly signed with a specific secret.

    post '/otherwebhook' => require_github_webhook_secret 'KUksrZyREtM32mIPoxcV7Cqx' => sub {
        do_something_with_correctly_signed_payload();
    };

    post '/otherwebhook' => require_github_webhook_secret config->{githubwebhooks}->{otherwebhook} => sub {
        do_something_with_correctly_signed_payload();
    };

=head1 CONTROLLING ACCESS TO ROUTES

=head2 require_github_webhook_secret [ $secret ]

    post '/reload-app' => require_github_webhook_secret 'mysecret' => sub {
        ...
    };

Only executes the route's sub if the payload is correctly signed. If no secret is given, we use the one 
you configured in your config file (see above). If you need different secrets within your app, you can 
provide it here or use on from the configuration file via C<< config->{anyconfigentry} >>.
